## And so it begins...

Setting up a blog had always been on my to-do lists. I had been focusing on college and other domains that it kept getting pushed to the bottom of my priorities. Now, on holidays, I have someleeway to check on stuff I somehow kept postponing (still I had to unearth it from the bottom of my never-ending plan to do list lol).

So for the last two days I had been reading on how to set it up using Hugo (heard it from my Linux loving buddy @ahmubashshir) and his blog inspired me to use the same theme as his. Ah, PaperMod, how nice you look~

### Anyway...
I'm glad I have all this sorted out by now. What remains is to fill this blog with interesting things (in my opinion).
