## Ohai :wave:

Welcome to my personal page and blog. Reizen here ;D

On this blog I'll mainly share my views on stuff from the tech perspective.

## Now more about me...

I am a technology enthusiast currently living in Mozambique. 
I am currently attending university at Eduardo Mondlane University, taking a computer science course.

I've recently taken a keen interest in Personal Knowledge Management and I'm using Obsidian to organize my personal notes :brain:
