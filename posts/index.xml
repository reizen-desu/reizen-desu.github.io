      <description>First post depicting how I set up my blog</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="and-so-it-begins">And so it begins&hellip;</h2>
<p>Setting up a blog had always been on my to-do lists. I had been focusing on college and other domains that it kept getting pushed to the bottom of my priorities. Now, on holidays, I have someleeway to check on stuff I somehow kept postponing (still I had to unearth it from the bottom of my never-ending plan to do list lol).</p>
<p>So for the last two days I had been reading on how to set it up using Hugo (heard it from my Linux loving buddy @ahmubashshir) and his blog inspired me to use the same theme as his. Ah, PaperMod, how nice you look~</p>
<h3 id="anyway">Anyway&hellip;</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I have all this sorted out by now. What remains is to fill this blog with interesting things (in my opinion).</p>]]></content:encoded>
